RE: Using GitHub to publish personal files.

I am creating a new personal GitHub repository in order to publish a link of a movie. The movie file 
is one I took of Berni describing the Twin's medical and legal files and where they live.

I'm using my thumb drive as local drive to store files: E:\GitHub\GitHub

Once I upload the movie file to the repository I will use GitHub Pages to publish a URL.
